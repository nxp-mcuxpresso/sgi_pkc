/**
 * Assembly macro to conditionally initialize PRNG base address
 *
 * This macro assumes the register (regPrngAddr) already contains the base address
 * of another hardware SFR (addressOtherHw). If the 2 SFR base addresses (PRNG and
 * the other hardware) are different, this macro will overwrite the register
 * with PRNG SFR base address. If both SFR base addresses are the same, this
 * macro will not do anything. Using this macro can avoid initializing register
 * with the same address.
 *
 * ps, RISC-V splits an address to (unsigned) higher 20 bits and (signed) lower 12 bits.
 * An address is split to the higher part, %hi(address) = (address + 0x800) >> 12, and lower part.
 * If higher 21 bits of 2 addresses are the same, they will map to the same higher part.
 *
 * regPrngAddr:    register to be updated to the base address to access PRNG
 * addressOtherHw: a constant, which is an address of another hardware SFR
